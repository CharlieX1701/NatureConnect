# NatureConnect
find any hike in the national park system

NatureConnect.py is the driver program which uses mainProgHikeProject.py to create an interactive window for users to search for hikes listed in the National Park
System. 
Hike.py takes in data from AllTrails and creates an output file allHikes.txt
readQuotes.py takes in data from a CSV with listed quotes/authors and creates an output file allQuotes.txt
